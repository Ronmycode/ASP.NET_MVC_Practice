# Expense Tracker – ASP.NET Core MVC Web App

This is a **Expense Tracker** project, developed as part of my learning journey with **ASP.NET Core MVC**. The project follows the tutorial  
[**“How to Build an ASP.NET Core MVC Web App – Tutorial”**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtiM87MV27w&t=3707s).

## Project Overview

The tutorial demonstrates key concepts of the **Model–View–Controller (MVC)** architecture, database integration with **Entity Framework Core**, and the use of **Chart.js** for dynamic data visualization.

### Main Features
- Add, view, and manage expense records.  
- Input validation using data annotations.  
- Persistent storage through a SQL Server database.  
- Interactive charts to visualize expense distribution.
